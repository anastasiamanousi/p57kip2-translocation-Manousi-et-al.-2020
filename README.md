# p57kip2-translocation-Manousi-et-al..-2020
This code calculates the percentage of cells with prevailed nuclear p57kip2 localization in one well of the 96-well plate, given that the p57kip2 signal intensity in the two regions (nucl vs. cyto) is provided as input.
The only parameter that changes is the threshold nucl(line 14), which compensates for differences in the overall signal intensity among the plates. This threshold is being set upon manual analysis of the positive and negative controls and under our experimental conditions was always 1000 +/- 200. 
Note: this threshold has to initially be set for each plate and is strictly being kept constant for the whole plate, otherwise this will be considered manipulation.
To detect the subcellular localization of the protein, cells were stained by means of immunofluorescence. Images were captured using the BD Pathway 855 High-Content Cell Analyzer (BD Biosciences, Rockville, MD, USA). Signal intensity of the anti-p57kip2 staining was measured in each region of interest (nucleus vs. cytoplasm) using the Attovision v.1.7.1 software package (BD Biosciences Systems, RRID:SCR_014315) and the exported data (in excel files) were imported in Matlab for the analysis.
